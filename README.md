Implementing a PID controller in C++

In this project I am revisiting the lake race track from the Behavioral Cloning Project.This time, however,I'm implementing a PID controller in C++ to maneuver the vehicle around the track!
The simulator will provide the cross track error (CTE) and the velocity (mph) in order to compute the appropriate steering angle.

## Dependencies

* cmake >= 3.5
 * make >= 4.1
  * Linux: make is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: [install Xcode command line tools to get make](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: [Click here for installation instructions](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
* gcc/g++ >= 5.4
  * Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: same deal as make - [install Xcode command line tools]((https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)
* [uWebSockets](https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets) == 0.13, but the master branch will probably work just fine.
